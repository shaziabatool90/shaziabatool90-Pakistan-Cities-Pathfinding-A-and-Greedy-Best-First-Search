# Pakistan-Cities-Pathfinding-A-and-Greedy-Best-First-Search
This Python project implements **A\*** and **Greedy Best-First Search algorithms** to find optimal paths between cities in Pakistan based on real geographic and heuristic data. The result is visualized using `matplotlib`.

## Features

- Supports:
  - A\* Search (with path cost + heuristic)
  - Greedy Best-First Search (heuristic only)
- Uses realistic city-to-city distances
- Visualizes paths using `matplotlib`
- Includes coordinates and edges of 18 major Pakistani cities
- Highlights the optimal route on a geographic map

---

## Cities Included

Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Larkana, Bahawalpur, Multan, Faisalabad,
Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Peshawar,
Quetta, Rahim Yar Khan, Jhang, Sargodha, Abbottabad

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib` – for visualization
- `heapq` – for priority queue in search
- `dictionary`, `tuple`, `list` structures
- Geographic heuristics & realistic cost estimation
